Compares language coverage in the PanLex API

## What it does

PanLex is an initiative from the Long Now Foundation to make translations available for all words
between any two languages.

I heard about PanLex at the same time as I heard about some constructed languages (in this example, Buck) which divide English into a hierarchy of terms.

For example:

```
4.20 “head”
  4.202 “skull”
  4.203 “brain”
  4.204 “face”
  4.205 “forehead”
...
4.21 “eye”
```

I wondered, would PanLex have more language support in certain categories, especially as you got more detailed? I'd expect German to have technical and engineering terms covered in great detail, while
a Pacific Island language such as Marshallese would be biased toward ocean and seafaring terms. This
isn't saying those words don't exist in the language or a dictionary somewhere, just that the translation is not yet included in PanLex, meaning it is more difficult to find, and maybe that is
significant.
